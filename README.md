# Module 13 â€“ Mapping earthquakes
# Unit Challenge
For this unit challenge, we have created an interactive using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and a JS library called [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/). This map will display data about earthquakes and tectonic plates all around the world.

The map contains three different layers:
1. All earthquakes around the world
2. Major earthquakes (magnitude 4.5 or more)
3. Tectonic plates borders

Any of these layers can be activated/deactivated to be shown or hidden. Also, these layers can be seen on top of any of the following map styles:

1. Streets views
2. Satellite view
3. Navigation night view

Feel free to play around with any combination possible.
